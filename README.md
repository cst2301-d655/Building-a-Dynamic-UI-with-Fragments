# Building-a-Dynamic-UI-with-Fragments
To create a dynamic and multi-pane user interface on Android, you need to encapsulate UI components and activity behaviors into modules that you can swap into and out of your activities. You can create these modules with the Fragment class, which behaves somewhat like a nested activity that can define its own layout and manage its own lifecycle.

Please follow these steps:

2. Visit the second section of the [Android training website][android-training], [Building a Dynamic UI with Fragments][lesson]. For this assignment, you will be completing the "[Creating a Fragment](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/creating.html)," "[Building a Flexible UI](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/fragment-ui.html)," and "[Communicating with Other Fragments](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/communicating.html)" sections.
3. Follow all the instructions of each section. **NOTE:** You may need to download the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) to work on this assignment. Please let me know if you have any trouble doing so.
4. Add *at least one fragment to your final project*. Upload your project to Blackboard.

*NOTE:* Use the emulator to test your work if you do not have an Android device handy. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
