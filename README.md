# Building-a-Dynamic-UI-with-Fragments
To create a dynamic and multi-pane user interface on Android, you need to encapsulate UI components and activity behaviors into modules that you can swap into and out of your activities. You can create these modules with the Fragment class, which behaves somewhat like a nested activity that can define its own layout and manage its own lifecycle.

Please follow these steps:

2. Visit the second section of the [Android training website][android-training], [Managing the Activity Lifecycle][lesson]. For this assignment, you will be completing the "[Creating a Fragment](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/creating.html)," "[Building a Flexible UI](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/fragment-ui.html)," and "[Communicating with Other Fragments](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/communicating.html)" sections.
3. Follow all the instructions of each section. **NOTE:** You must download the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) to work on this assignment. Please let me know if you have any trouble doing so.
4. [**Initialize** a git repository][ref-init] on the project you create in the studio.
5. [**Commit**][ref-commit] changes that you made to complete your solution.
4. [**Fork** this repository][forking] on GitHub into your own account. Grab the https URL that contains your username, as usual.
5. [**Pull** the forked repository][ref-pull] into your local one. This step is a little different than before because here you are creating a project from scratch. When I give you starter code, normally, you would [clone it][ref-clone]. Since you created a project from scratch, this step links your local repository to the one you forked on GitHub.
6. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
7. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
8. Submit your GitHub **username** on [Blackboard][blackboard].

*NOTE:* Use the emulator to test your work if you do not have an Android device handy. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
